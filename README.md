# positivitea
Positivitea is a two-tiered project. Our website features quiz to diagnose whether one has anxiety and if they do, to what extent they have it (mild or severe). Our app features a repository of emergency hotlines, mental health resources, a translator, and visual aids to assist those who need it.
